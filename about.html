            <p>I'm an Irish artist currently based in the capital city of Dublin. My practice is interdisciplinary and I work with a variety of materials and processes. This often takes the form of video works with scripted voiceover. Alongside this visual output, writing and text-based works are important elements to my research and practice.</p>
            <p>Throughout my work I use objects, images, details and textures as catalysts for narratives that fall somewhere between fact, fiction and myth. I'm interested in concealed, unspoken and hidden histories, and throughout my work there is a desire to examine and reveal. I continue to explore ways of doing this by creating unusual links between various objects, histories and processes. Drawing upon aspects of personal history and ongoing research into psychological processes, my work deals with themes of memory and loss, weaving together reflections on various healing and therapeutic practices. I use a variety of working methods which are underpinned by the act of collecting. The consideration of time as a material extends to the formation of pace and narrative within my video works. Gesture and performance have come into my work through performance to video, and more recently to live audience through performative presentation.</p>
            <p>I recently graduated with a first class honours from the MA Art in the Contemporary World programme at the NCAD, Dublin, which I took through a combined theory/practice pathway. Upcoming and recent events include the RDS Visual Art Awards, video screenings at the Edinburgh Artists' Moving Image Festival, EXCESS BAGGAGE at Laurieston Arches, Glasgow, hosted by WAVEparticle, and an audio contribution to the upcoming online edition of the Critical Bastards journal.</p>
            <p>Since graduating from my undergraduate Fine Art degree, DIT Portland Row, in 2007 I have exhibited in multiple group exhibitions throughout Ireland and abroad. I have also worked on collaborative projects with other artists, writers and curators. While studying on the MA ACW programme I developed new and existing strands to my art-making and writing practices which I continue to develop through various solo and collaborative projects. In 2014, 2015 and 2016 I was awarded the Fingal Arts Office Artistâ€™s Support Scheme Bursary.</p>
